    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="meta">Last updated: February 19, 2026</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how OCDATA (“we,” “us,” “our”) handles information when you use the OCDATA - MC application (“App”).</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Access</h2>
    <p>With your permission, the App reads QuickBooks Online accounting data needed for analysis, reporting, and advisory insights.</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>We use accessed data to generate financial analysis and summaries. The App is designed for read-only access and does not write back to your QuickBooks records.</p>

    <h2>3. Data Minimization and Redaction</h2>
    <p>Before analysis workflows, sensitive fields are reduced or redacted where feasible to minimize exposure of personal or confidential details.</p>

    <h2>4. Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>OAuth tokens are stored encrypted at rest. We implement reasonable administrative and technical safeguards to protect data.</p>

    <h2>5. Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell your data. We may share limited data with service providers necessary to operate the App (for example, Intuit for QuickBooks connectivity and AI processing providers
  for analysis output).</p>

    <h2>6. Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain data only as long as needed to provide the service, comply with legal obligations, and resolve disputes.</p>

    <h2>7. Your Choices</h2>
    <p>You can revoke App access from your Intuit account at any time. You may also contact us to request deletion of locally stored app artifacts, where applicable.</p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy by posting a revised version at this URL. Continued use of the App after updates indicates acceptance.</p>
